# udacity-DAND-P1
This is the first project that I completed for the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) at Udacity in FEB 2016. 
I performed the dependent samples t-test through Python and R to examine the Stroop effect. 
You can preview the result through [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yoondata/udacity-DAND-P1/blob/master/PARK_Sangyoon_Udacity_DAND_P1.html).
